    "Here we will outline the simplest possible full analysis via generator. This analysis should include the following routines: \n",
    "1) QTAIM - the original QTAIM analysis including critical point data, and graphs \n",
    "2) Charges - partial charges, you can set the number of calcs with full_set. Baseline includes hirshfeld, adch, cm5, and becke\n",
    "3) Bonding - Fuzzy, IBSI, Laplacian bonding schemes\n",
    "4) Fuzzy - several fuzzy analysis routines\n",
    "5) Other - mainly geometric information but a whole suite of features Multiwfn computes\n",

    "NB: this method below looks for wfn or gbw files. If there is only a gbw file, it first converts via orca6_2mkl. wfn files work directly. "
